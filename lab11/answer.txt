ex1. - page size is 32 words;
	 - 4 TLB hits, 6 TLB misses, 0 page hits and 6 page faults
	 - no page hits. because only have 4 physical pages and they are cached in TLB, each time a page is not in TLB, it cannot be in memory, hence not in page table.
	 - first get the virtual page number and look for it in TLB.
	 if TLB hit, get the physical page number and use offset to access memory; if TLB miss, look up page table. if page hits, update TLB and access memory;
	 if page fault, allocate physical page and update page table and TLB, if no empty page is available, evict LRU(or random) page.

ex3. double the memory size can reduce page faults to 8 and keep TLB misses 10.
ex4. the VIMSIM has 4 processes running, denoted by P1-P4. these processes share the same physical memory and each one has its own TLB and page table. the 
processes runs alternatively. the percentage of TLB misses is higher because when a process is sleeping, the running process may evict its physical page, 
resulting its TLB entry to be invalid.
